WebGL experiment

[live](http://jacobhamblin.github.io/koatasc)

## Features

* Scroll to transition between each scene using a greensock animation on camera.
* Maintains excellent performance despite hundreds of (would be) 3D objects using sprites.

## What are the orbs?

I generated the orbs in Cinema4D where I could apply interesting materials. While I wasn't able to find a way to bring the materials with the C4d object when exporting the C4D objects into three.js, I was able to accomplish something similar by saving images of the orbs and placing them in my 3d scene as sprites.

## What's with the name?

It's just seven random characters.
